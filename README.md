## Introduction

The Fridge program is designed to help you manage your refrigerator inventory efficiently. It consists of three primary classes: `Item.cs`, `Shelf.cs`, and `Refrigerator.cs`, each responsible for different aspects of your refrigerator inventory management.

## Classes

### Item.cs

The `Item.cs` class is responsible for managing individual items within the refrigerator inventory. It contains various methods and properties to handle items. Here are some of the methods within the `Item.cs` class:

- `ToString()` - Returns a string that clearly represents the item.
- `isExpired()` - Returns whether a product is expired or not.



Example usage:

```csharp
// Create an instance of the Item class
item = new Item(itemName, itemType, itemKosher, itemExpiry, itemSpace);
```


### Shelf.cs

The `Shelf.cs` class is responsible for managing individual items within the refrigerator inventory. It contains various methods and properties to handle items. Here are some of the methods within the `Shelf.cs` class:

- `CalculateSpaceLeftInShelf()` - Returns a double value that represents how much free space in centimeters remains on the shelf.
- `AddItemToShelf(Item item)` - Adds an item to the shelf.
- `ItemExistInShelf(int idItem)` - Returns whether a product is xists on the shelf or not.

- `CleanShelf()` - All expired items are deleted.

shelf.AddItemToShelf(item);
```
